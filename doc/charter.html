  <h2>Special projects</h2>
  <p><code>www</code> (subdomain <code>www.scheme.org</code>): The
  <code>scheme.org</code> web front page.</p>
  <p><code>lists</code> (subdomain <code>lists.scheme.org</code>):
  <code>@scheme.org</code> mailing lists.</p>
  <p><code>staging</code> (subdomain
  <code>staging.scheme.org</code>): Staging versions of production
  projects.</p>
  <h2>Email</h2>
  <p>The following standard <code>@scheme.org</code> email
  addresses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>hostmaster</code></li>
    <li><code>postmaster</code></li>
    <li><code>webmaster</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>All other <code>@scheme.org</code> addresses are reserved for
  mailing lists hosted at <code>lists.scheme.org</code>.</p>
  <p><em>Community projects</em> shall not run mail service on
  their subdomains.</p>
  <p><em>Owned projects</em> are free to run public and/or private
  mailing lists, and to have private mailboxes, on their subdomains
  if they so choose.</p>
  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <p>All Scheme.org projects need to follow these rules:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>No cookies or other local storage. Exception: session for
      users who explicitly logged in.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>No tracking of user behavior. Exception: ordinary server
      logs (web server and ssh logs, etc.) So-called
      <em>analytics</em> services are not allowed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>No embedded content from commercial services (video,
      audio, images, maps, status badges, etc.). These contain
      hidden trackers so often that it's easier to have a blanket
      ban than examine on a case-by-case basis. Links to commercial
      hosts are fine as long as the link itself does not contain a
      tracking or affiliate token.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>No commerce. Links to commerce outside scheme.org are
      fine, as long as the link does not read like an
      advertisement.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>No political, religious, or lifestyle advocacy.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>When in doubt, please ask on the <code>schemeorg</code>
  mailing list.</p>
  <h2>Procedures</h2>
  <h3>Adding a project</h3>
  <h3>Re-assigning a community project</h3>
  <p>If a <em>subdomain administrator</em> of a community project
  is out of reach for an extended period of time, the <em>top-level
  administrators</em> may remove the <em>subdomain
  administrator</em> status of that person from community
  projects.</p>
  <p>If <strong>all</strong> <em>subdomain administrators</em> of a
  community project are out of reach for an extended period of
  time, the <em>top-level administrators</em> may remove the DNS
  records for the subdomain or change them to point to a new
  server.</p>
  <h3>Settling disputes between project administrators</h3>
  <p><em>Subdomain administrators</em> strive to settle all
  disputes between themselves and with the subdomains' users
  without requiring the intervention of <em>top-level
  administrators</em>.</p>
  <p>If they cannot come to an agreement, <em>top-level
  administrators</em> will act as tie breakers, deciding what to do
  about the subdomain.</p>
  <h3>Dealing with content that is against the rules</h3>
  <p>If someone notifies the <em>top-level administrators</em> of
  content against the rules, the <em>top-level administrators</em>
  send a private email to all <em>subdomain administrators</em> of
  the subdomain in question.</p>
  <p>7 full days from the time the first mail was sent, if the
  content has not been removed, the <em>top-level
  administrators</em> may hide the subdomain link on the
  <code>www.scheme.org</code> front page.</p>
  <p>30 full days from the time the first mail was sent, if the
  content has not been removed, the <em>top-level
  administrators</em> may drop DNS records for the subdomain.</p>
  <p>Once all problems have been fixed, the <em>top-level
  administrators</em> will restore front-page links and DNS records
  ASAP.</p>
  <h3>Dealing with security problems</h3>
  <p>If a subdomain compromises the security of visitors or of
  <code>scheme.org</code> infrastructure, the <em>top-level
  administrators</em> may immediately hide the subdomain link on
  the <code>www.scheme.org</code> front page. If the problem is
  especially severe, the <em>top-level administrators</em> may also
  drop DNS records for the subdomain. In both cases the
  <em>top-level administrators</em> send a private email to all
  <em>subdomain administrators</em> of the subdomain in question.
  If the <em>top-level administrators</em> judge that it is safe to
  do so, they will also send a public email to the
  <code>schemeorg</code> mailing list - either immediately, after
  consulting with the <em>subdomain administrators</em>, or after
  waiting a while and the <em>subdomain administrators</em> have
  not responded.</p>
  <p>Once all problems have been fixed, the <em>top-level
  administrators</em> will restore front-page links and DNS records
  ASAP.</p>
  <h3>Dealing with reliability problems</h3>
  <p>If a subdomain server has been unresponsive for 7 full days,
  the <em>top-level administrators</em> may remove it from the
  front page so as to not confuse visitors.</p>
  <p>Once all problems have been fixed, the <em>top-level
  administrators</em> will restore front-page links ASAP.</p>
