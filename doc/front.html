  <p>Scheme is a classic programming language in the <a class=
  "offsite" href=
  "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp
  family</a>. It emphasizes <a class="offsite" href=
  "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional
  programming</a> and <a class="offsite" href=
  "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">domain-specific
  languages</a> but adapts to other styles. Known for its clean and
  minimalist design, Scheme is one of the longest-lived and
  best-studied <a class="offsite" href=
  "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language">dynamic
  languages</a>, and has many fast and portable
  implementations.</p>
  <p>From the Scheme standard reports:</p>
  <blockquote>
    Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature
    on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and
    restrictions that make additional features appear necessary.
    Scheme demonstrates that a very small number of rules for
    forming expressions, with no restrictions on how they are
    composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient programming
    language that is flexible enough to support most of the major
    programming paradigms in use today.
