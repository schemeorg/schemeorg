  <h2>Explanation</h2>
  <p>Some subdomains of Scheme.org are just HTTP redirects. Each of
  those subdomains has a DNS CNAME pointing to
  <code>redirect.scheme.org</code>.</p>
  <p>The subdomain <code>redirect.scheme.org</code> itself has a
  CNAME pointing to the origin server of Scheme.org. This subdomain
  exists to make <a href=
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schemeorg/schemeorg/master/dns/scheme.org.zone">
  our dns zone</a> easier to read. If the zone listed over 20
  subdomains pointing to the origin server, it would be hard to
  figure out which sites are actually hosted on that server and
  which are mere redirects.</p>
  <p>It may seem excessive to put so much effort into the
  readability of a DNS zone but the zone is the most central part
  of Scheme.org. The long-term maintenance of the domain relies on
  its structure being transparent to any interested party, not just
  to one or two sysadmins.</p>
  <h2>Maintenance</h2>
  <p>The ground truth lies in <a href=
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schemeorg/schemeorg/master/projects.pose">
  <code>projects.pose</code></a>. Search for <code>redirect</code>
  in that file and you will find everything pertinent.</p>
